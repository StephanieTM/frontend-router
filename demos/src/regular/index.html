    <p>Once Pepper and Dilsey both escaped through a hole in the screen door.  We found them an hour later, walking side by side in the woods behind our house.</p>

    <p>Whenever Pepper went out for a walk, Dilsey would sit by the front door and meow and wait for her mama to return.  But when Pepper did return, Dilsey, like the cat she was, would casually turn around and pretend she had just stopped for a quick dip in the sun on her way to somewhere else.</p>

    <p>After Pepper died, Dilsey sat at the door for three days waiting for her to come back from her walk.</p>

    <p>Angie is a chocolate lab that my parents bought a week after Pepper died.  There was another dog between Pepper and Angie, but its relationship with my parents was&hellip; short-lived.  Somewhere my father has a picture of the dog, whose name I forget.  Somewhere my father also has a picture of the couch that the dog destroyed on its first and last day home.</p>

    <p>So anyway, Angie.  Angie is very nice, and energetic, and bouncy-like-Tigger, and all the things that labradors are supposed to be.  In this picture, she is playing with a squeaker ball that she got for Christmas one year.  The squeaker lasted 5 minutes; the ball lasted 10.  The look on her face is saying, &ldquo;Well that was fun; what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Angie is many things, but she is not Pepper.  Which is to say, Dilsey has never forgiven her for being the dog that replaced Pepper.  This evens out to the stereotypical dog-cat relationship, but the origins of it are complex and worth special mention.</p>

    <p>Angie is very good with kids, which is a Good Thing, since we have kids now.  (Adagio is also good with kids, in the same way that an inert toupee of knotted fur could be said to be &ldquo;good with kids.&rdquo;)  The only downside is that Angie doesn&rsquo;t know her own strength; she can knock over the kids just saying hello.  On the upside, we&rsquo;ve taught the kid how to say, &ldquo;No, dog!&rdquo; in three languages.  On the downside, Angie doesn&rsquo;t understand any of those languages, or if she does, she hides it well.</p>

    <p>Finally there is Adagio, the first dog I could truly call my own.  I graduated college on a Saturday, moved into my own apartment on a Sunday, and got Adagio from the SPCA on Monday.  I am told she is a Tibetian terrier.  &ldquo;Adagio&rdquo; is a musical term, a tempo marking; it means &ldquo;slowly.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In my first job out of college, I was working out of a makeshift office in my boss&rsquo;s house in Richmond, Indiana.  I took Adagio to work almost every day.  Later my boss moved to Philadelphia, and I worked out of an office in the local ISP.  Adagio had a place there too; she even had her own dog bed next to my desk (a $5 beanbag chair from Wal-mart, but she wasn&rsquo;t picky).  She would just lie there all day watching me work.  Occasionally she would pose for pictures to test our state-of-the-art digital camera.  That was the extent of her physical activity.</p>

    <p>Once, my boss asked if Adagio liked chasing tennis balls.  Adagio was sprawled out on the floor beneath our feet.  I took the tennis ball he was holding, leaned down, and placed it next to her nose.  She blinked, got up slowly, moved one foot away, and lay back down again.</p>
